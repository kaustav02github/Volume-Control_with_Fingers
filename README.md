# Volume Control with Fingers

This project demonstrates a solution to control the system volume using hand gestures. It leverages **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe** for hand tracking and gesture recognition, and **PyCaw** for controlling the system audio.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe.
- Gesture-based volume control:
  - Adjust the system volume by changing the distance between your thumb and index finger.
  - Visual feedback with a volume bar and FPS display.
- Works with a webcam for live input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - Mediapipe
  - NumPy
  - PyCaw
  - Comtypes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/volume-control-with-fingers.git
